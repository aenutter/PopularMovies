UDACITY NanoDegree ~ Developing Android Apps

Popular Movies App ~ Project Overview

 We will split the development of this app in two stages. First, let's talk about stage 1. In this stage youâ€™ll build the core experience of your movies app.

You app will:

    Present the user with a grid arrangement of movie posters upon launch.
    Allow your user to change sort order via a setting:
        The sort order can be by most popular or by highest-rated
    Allow the user to tap on a movie poster and transition to a details screen with additional information such as:
        original title
        movie poster image thumbnail
        A plot synopsis (called overview in the api)
        user rating (called vote_average in the api)
